# Introduction and Purpose

Welcome to the VMware vRO code repository! This platform serves as a resource hub for developers working with vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) workflows and scripts. The main purpose of this repository is to address the lack of readily available vRO sample codes. It brings together scripts and plugins that enhance the functionality of vRO, making automation processes smoother and more efficient. ðŸŒŸ

For vRO users, especially newcomers, this repository offers a wealth of resources. By providing open access to these samples, it encourages community engagement and collaboration, helping developers save time on script creation.

Additionally, this repository includes a Postman Collection for the vRO Swagger API and unofficial plugins that expand vRO's capabilities. ðŸ“š These resources are crafted and continuously refined based on user feedback, ensuring practical value.

Contributors are encouraged to engage with the repository by reporting issues or submitting pull requests. Through these efforts, the repository evolves to meet the growing needs of the vRO community. We invite all developers to explore, utilize, and contribute to enhancing this dynamic repository. ðŸš€
