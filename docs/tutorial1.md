# Building a VMware vRO Project with the VMware vRO Code Repository

Discover how to streamline your automation processes using the VMware vRO code repository. This guide will help you set up a project using the samples and resources available in this repository. ðŸŽ¯

## Why Use This Repository?

In VMware environments, vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) scripts are vital but not always easily accessible. This repository addresses that by providing a range of sample codes to help automate tasks more efficiently.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with VMware vRealize Orchestrator
- Basic understanding of JavaScript
- Access to a VMware environment for deploying vRO workflows

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the repository to your local environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imtrinity94/vmware_vro.git
cd vmware_vro
```

## Step 2: Explore the Postman Collection for vRO Swagger API

The repository includes a Postman collection that simplifies API interactions with vRO, enhancing your ability to automate and test workflows.

- **Postman Collection**: [Download here](https://github.com/imtrinity94/vmware_vro/blob/d887ed9a534ff2eda68d19475aa8fffae6048608/vRealize%20Orchestrator%20Server%20API_8.3.postman_collection.json).

## Step 3: Enhance vRO with Unofficial Plugins

Boost your vRO environment by integrating some unofficial plugins:

- [vRealize Orchestrator Encryption Plugin - Crypto](https://github.com/vmware/o11n-plugin-crypto)
- [Cache plug-in for vRealize Orchestrator](https://github.com/dimitrovvlado/o11n-plugin-cache)
- [Redis plug-in for vRealize Orchestrator](https://github.com/dimitrovvlado/o11n-plugin-redis)
- [JsonPath plug-in for vRealize Orchestrator](https://cloudadvisors.net/2016/05/09/new-orchestrator-jsonpath-plugin/)

## Step 4: Adhere to JavaScript Standard Style

Consistent coding standards are key for readability. This repository follows JavaScript Standard Style. Learn more at [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/rules.html).

## Step 5: Dynamic Types Setup

Utilize Dynamic Types to enhance your vRO setup:

- [Starter to Dynamic Types](https://www.vcoteam.info/articles/learn-vco/323-how-to-create-a-microsoft-dns-dynamic-types-plug-in.html)
- [More on Dynamic Types](https://vbombarded.wordpress.com/2017/11/21/a-primer-on-vrealize-orchestrator-dynamic-types/#more-1180)

For creating your own plugins without the Java SDK, see the [Guide to Creating Your Own vRO Plugin](https://github.com/imtrinity94/vmware_vro/files/6663022/vRealize.Orchestrator.Dynamic.Ty_793c45ef6cb84252802a350fc8712a1e-160421-0633-172.pdf).

## Step 6: Contribute & Collaborate

Developers are encouraged to contribute to the repository. If you encounter issues or have suggestions:

- Report issues: [Create an issue](https://github.com/imtrinity94/vmware_vro/issues/new)
- Share scripts: [Create a pull request](https://github.com/imtrinity94/vmware_vro/compare)

## Conclusion

By utilizing these resources and techniques, you'll be better equipped to deploy robust vRO workflows. Your contributions play a significant role in driving the community forwardâ€”let's build and enhance together! ðŸš€
